# 42 School Projects

This repository contains my main programming projects developed during my time at [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de).  
All of them were written in C and built to strengthen low-level programming skills such as memory management, algorithmic problem-solving, and Unix system logic.

## ðŸ§  Overview

| Project | Description | Main Topics |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Libft**(./libft) | A custom implementation of essential C standard library functions. | Pointers, memory allocation, linked lists |
| **get_next_line**(./get_next_line) | Reads a line from a file descriptor efficiently. | Static variables, buffers, I/O management |
| **ft_printf**(./ft_printf) | Recreation of the standard `printf` function. | Variadic functions, string formatting |
| **so_long**(./so_long) | A simple 2D game using the MiniLibX graphics library. | Event handling, basic game logic, graphics |
| **push_swap**(./push_swap) | Sorting algorithms challenge using two stacks and limited operations. | Algorithms, complexity, data structures |
| **minitalk**(./minitalk)  | A small communication program using Unix signals to transmit messages between processes. | Signals, process communication, bitwise operations |

## ðŸ§© About 42

[42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) is an international programming school based on peer learning, project-based education, and no teachers or formal classes.  
The curriculum focuses on mastering fundamentals through rigorous, self-driven projects that simulate real-world software challenges.

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned

Through these projects I developed a deep understanding of:
- How computers manage memory and processes  
- How to write efficient, readable C code  
- The importance of debugging and testing systematically  
- Collaborative development in a peer-to-peer environment
